1. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
Format: see example
You are not allowed to use arrays
You are not allowed to use malloc
You are not allowed to use the % or / operators

2. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
Format: see example
You are not allowed to use arrays
You are not allowed to use malloc

3. Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get
Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an error occured

4. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set
Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred
